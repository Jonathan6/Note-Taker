## Overview

The goal of the project was to help me learn Express JS, since the first step to developing full stack websites is to first understand how to utilize a web framework. The purpose of a web framework is to let us easily access the backend database through different routes, which allow us to manipulate data in different ways. This project simplifies the process by not using a database language and instead saving all the data into a JSON file. Since most of new concepts was just understanding and developing routes, the process was very simple, intuitive, and easy to pick up. Looking at how the backend was set up, it is clear the drawbacks of not using a database language. For starters accessing the data was very difficult. To just read the data we needed to read the entire database, and this applied to changing the database as well, leading to a lot of time wasted especially if we were making a lot of changes or the database grows. 

The other concept was Heroku. Heroku is a website hosting service that hosts your Github projects from the cloud. It provides many useful features including being able to host dynamic files, which in this case allows us to have a dynamic webpage rather than our static webpages from projects before. This was a bit tricky
